description: The Subjection of Women is an essay written by John Stuart Mill in 1869,
  stating an argument in favor of equality between the sexes. At the time it was published,
  this essay was an affront to European conventional norms of views on stature of
  men and women. Mill credited his wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, with co-writing the
  essay, although she is rarely credited on publications. The Subjection of Women"
  offers both detailed argumentation and passionate eloquence in opposition to the
  social and legal inequalities commonly imposed upon women by a patriarchal culture
